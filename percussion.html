  <h3>Percussion Family</h3>
  <p>The percussion family can range from small to big, short to long, and no matter the size they all have something in common and that is they all produce sounds when struck or hit. This family also includes any instruments as long as they make sounds when they are either hit, struck, or shookt. Some instruments under this family can be tuned and can sound different just like the xylophone, timpani or piano these are called the pitch instruments. Some cannot be tuned instruments such as these are the bass drum, cymbals or castanets or in other words called the unpitched instruments.. Some common instruments under this family are the timpani, xylophone, cymbals, triangle, snare drum, bass drum, tambourine, maracas, gongs, chimes, celesta, and piano.
</p>
  <p>The percussion family is believed to be one of the oldest kinds of instruments they can be associated with the simple clapping in the early parts of our history. Drums made of alligator skins were also found in ancient China believed to be around 5500-2350 BC. Drums were also discovered in ancient Egypt at around 4000 BC. The Xylophone has also been seen around 2000 BC and was documented in temple carvings. Jumping to the 14th century and the triangle has been seen used to make sounds. The timpani or kettle drums were introduced to Europe by the Ottoman empire in the 15th century. Then in the 1400â€™s the snare drum was seen used by the Swiss army.
</p>
  <p>The percussion family can be classified into the Idiophone wherein it is hit to make vibrations which in turn into sounds and the membranophone that is stretched to make vibrations that make sounds too. Although the drums are included in the list of instruments that are unpitched, they can however still change its tune just by adjusting the tightness of the drum. The tighter the adjustment the higher the note produced. Size also matters as the bigger the size of the drum it is the lower the note produced. Percussion instruments can also change its sound by using different kinds of beaters used to hit it.
