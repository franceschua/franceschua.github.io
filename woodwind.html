  <h3>Woodwind Family</h3>
  <p>The woodwind family is a instrument, as can be seen in its name, are instruments that were all used to be made from wood. Nowadays however, they can be made up of metal, wood, plastic, or a combination of all of those three. The woodwind family makes it sound by blowing into a mouthpiece which will then connect to a narrow cylinder or pipe with holes and then out to the bottom of the. You can also tell that from its name it gets its sound from the wind that we produce when we blow into the instrument. Some of the basic instruments under this family is the Clarinet, Oboe, Bassoon, Recorders, and Saxophones. Similar to the string family the instruments here, the smaller they are the higher pitch it would play and the bigger and longer the instrument is the lower the pitch becomes.
</p>
  <p>Now the woodwind family gets its sound primarily from the air blown by woodwind players. The flute for example when blown with air gets split by a the edge which causes vibrations and thus makes its sounds. This edge may be at the mouthpiece or further inside the instrument. For the reed however as air is blown into it, the sound of vibrations made are caused by a thin piece of wood called the reed. After air is blown into the mouthpiece it goes through a pipe or narrow cylinder wherein it is covered with holes. Now what the holes do is change the length of how far the air travels by doing this the note changes. On the end of a woodwind instrument there is a bell wherein it helps to make low notes.
</p>
  <p>The flute dates back to almost 50,000 years ago and recent discovery shows that they found a flute from Eastern Europe believed to be between 35,000 and 50,000 years old made of cave bear bone. Other ancient flutes show that there were flutes made from hollow bird bones. The Clarinet however was invented by Johann Christoph Denner of Germany and his son. The Clarinet underwent changes from 1700s to the 1800s during those years the Clarinet followed the fluteâ€™s fingering system and during those years the people also played with the with different tone holes and made adjustments to the keys in order to alter the pitch. The Saxophone however ie very iconic especially to Jazz fans throughout the world. This magnificent instrument was invented by Adolphe Sax, who also introduced it to the French military band in 1845. It is one of the youngest instruments today and was inspired by instruments like the flute, clarinet, and the french horn.
