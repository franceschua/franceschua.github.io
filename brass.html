  <h3>Brass Family</h3>
  <p>	The brass family is basically a family of instruments wherein the sound it produces is from the breath of the brass players. This family is one of the loudest families in the music world and they can be heard even from a distance. They get their sound from the vibrations that we produce from our breaths which then transfers to the mouthpiece which is then amplified. The brass family has five major instruments under it. It consists of firstly the more famous one the trumpet and its close relative the cornet, followed by the french horn. The next three are the Trombone, Baritone or Euphonium two different kinds of instruments but closely similar, and the Tuba or Saxophone again both have minor differences.
</p>
  <p>	Now these five instruments all basically have the same similar way of producing sound which is by blowing into the mouthpiece which then creates vibrations in the air inside the instrument which in then translates to sound. There are three major parts that get the brass family going, these three are the valves, slides, and the bore or bell. The valves and slides essentially have the same goal and that is to add or reduce the length of the instrument. Adding or reducing length means that the instrument can have varying tones and thus producing different effects and sounds. The bore or bell however is the part that you usually see in the end of the instrument. That is where the sound usually comes out. 
        </p>
<p>	The earliest instruments or relatives of the brass family were made of either bronze, silver, or even wood. Some examples would be the salpinx found in Greece, and the Roman tuba, lituus, and buccina. During the Renaissance period many advancements were made, during the 1400-1413 the earliest known S-shaped trumpet was developed, which was later followed by the folded trumpet and slide trumpet. It was also during the 1450 wherein the trombone was developed. During this era the new slide system was also further improved and designed to improve the musicianâ€™s technique. Fast forward to the 17th century and the brass family again made further improvements and developments. The design was further improved and the valve had some tweaks here and there to better function the upper overtones. The years after that came after all have been significant to what the brass family is right now and it still continues to become better as it is being improved daily.
