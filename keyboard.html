  <h3>Keyboard Family</h3>
  <p>The keyboard family includes any family that uses an keyboard to play it. This means that it has a row of levers that are pressed by the playerâ€™s fingers. Some of the instruments under this family include the piano, organ, and various electronic keyboards, including synthesizers and digital pianos. The keyboard family has three main parts the keys, the buttons, and the Parallel Levers. The keys are set in a specific manner called the chromatic scale wherein the base notes are on the left while the treble notes on the right.
</p>
  <p>The first keyboard instrument was a hydraulis, a pipe organ powered by water. This was invented by Ctesibus of Alexandria in the late 3rd century BC. Some improvements were made during the middle ages as it now had sliders that can be pulled to make different notes. During the 14th century one of the first keyboard instruments appeared in Europe the dulcimer. In the 15th century instruments such as spinet, virginal, clavecin, and harpsichord saw a development. The harpsichord during the 15th century was one of the instruments that stood out the most and this instrument also closely resembles the modern day piano, however this instrument could only be played in one volume. In 1709 the piano was invented by Bartolomeo di Francesco Cristofori, an Italian harpsichord  maker. A hundred years later during 1863 the pianista which was a piano player was invented by Henri Fourneaux.
</p>
  <p>The keyboard family specifically the piano includes parts such as the keyboard, tuning pins, hammers, soundboard, treble strings, cast iron plate, and the bass strings.  The keyboard instrument gets it sounds from striking, plucking, and by using air. It is essentially a mixture of the strings family, the percussion family, and the woodwinds.
